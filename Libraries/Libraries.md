Libraries are collections of functionalities and utilities that developers can use to solve specific problems. They provide a more flexible way to include features in the code without enforcing a specific structure or approach.

## Features of Libraries

- **Specific functionalities**: Libraries provide ready-made solutions for specific problems (e.g., date manipulation, array handling, etc.).
- **Flexibility in structure**: They do not impose a rigid structure or rules about how the code should be organized.
- **Optional use**: Libraries are used as needed in different parts of the application without requiring adherence to a predetermined architecture.
- **Greater freedom for the developer**: The developer has more control over the organization and structure of the application.

## Conclusion

Libraries offer specific functionalities without enforcing a coding style or architecture, providing greater flexibility for the developer when building applications.
