# Frameworks

Frameworks are comprehensive structures that provide a foundation for developing applications. They include conventions, architecture, and integrated features that help developers follow a specific pattern when building an application.

## Features of Frameworks

- **Ready-to-use structure**: Frameworks provide a defined structure to organize and structure the code.
- **Integrated conventions**: They impose a specific way of doing things, including coding rules and patterns.
- **Built-in functionalities**: In addition to guiding the application's structure, frameworks offer ready-made resources like state management, routing, and data validation.
- **Requires adherence to a specific approach**: Developers must follow the conventions and coding style set by the framework.

## Conclusion

Frameworks provide a complete structure and impose specific conventions that help organize applications but limit the developer's freedom in terms of architecture and coding style.
