Hello, my name is Patrick, I created this project to learn different languages ​​and in case I forget something in my day to day work, I hope it will be as useful for you as it was for me :)

# Programming Concepts Showcase

This project is designed to demonstrate the implementation of logic and functions across various programming languages. It serves as a learning resource and a practical guide for developers who want to explore and understand how common programming concepts are expressed in different syntaxes and paradigms.

## Features

- **Multi-language Examples**: Code snippets and examples written in multiple programming languages.
- **Logic Implementations**: Demonstrations of common algorithms and logical operations.
- **Function Definitions**: Examples of function creation, parameter handling, and return types in different languages.
- **Cross-language Comparisons**: Insights into similarities and differences between languages.

## Goals

- Provide a comparative view of programming languages.
- Help developers learn new languages by observing familiar patterns.
- Serve as a reference for solving problems in various programming environments.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest new examples to enrich this project!
